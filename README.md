# Huddle-curved-sections
FrontEnd Mentor project, was my first time using the pre processer SASS in a project. I used also Intersection Observer to make some animations while I scrolled.
Had some troubles with the backgrounds so I used Figma to join them and made export them as images instead of svg's.
